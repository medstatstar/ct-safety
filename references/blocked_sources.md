# ct-safety — Blocked / Excluded Safety Sources (verified 2026-09-01)

Not silently dropped — each was tested from this machine; reasons are also recorded in
`multi_source.COUNT_SOURCE_FEASIBILITY` / `corroborative_sources.BLOCKED_SOURCES`.

| VAERS / CDC WONDER | Needs data-use agreement (403) |
| EudraVigilance (EMA) | Needs authorization |
| VigiAccess / VigiBase (WHO) | No public API (SPA; full access paid) |

Re-test before claiming "no data" — conditions may change.
